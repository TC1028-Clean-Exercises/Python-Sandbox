# Basic instructions

Space to practice the Python conditions with `if / elif / else`.

Copy the `template.py` file to add new Python files to test.
It is recommended that you name the files starting with a number, so that they
keep an order and it is easier to find them. For example:
- 01_hello.py
- 02_variables.py
- 03_operators.py

Put your code inside the `main` function.
The basic template looks something like:
```python
def main():
    # Replace this comment and the `pass` instruction with your code
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
